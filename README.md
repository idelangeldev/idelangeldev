- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name's Israel, but feel free to call me "Izzy" (si hablas espaÃ±ol puedes decirme "Isra"), and I'm 39 years old . I like learning and taking on new challenges: there's no impossible, just not enough know-how. 


- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm learning HTML/CSS on Udemy.com and will be finishing the course soon. Eventually, I plan on taking <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>PHP</strong>, etc, and becoming a true Web Developer. For now, though, HTML/CSS is my foot in the door.

- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach me:
